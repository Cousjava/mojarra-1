<!--
     This document contains test scenarios for the implementation
     of the default NavigationHandler implementation, as described
     in Section 7.4.2 of the spec.  These rules assume that an
     application configuration file including all of the example
     navigation rules in Section 7.4.3 has been processed.

     Each test scenario is represented by a "test" element with the
     following attributes:

     fromViewId                view id from the view currently
                               being processed (required)

     fromAction             Action reference of the action that
                               was invoked (optional)

     fromOutcome               Logical outcome from the
                               action that was called (optional)

     toViewId                  view id of the view that should be
                               selected next, which may be the same
                               as the from view (required)
